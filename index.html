<h1>Country Representation at the Olympic Games</h1>
	
<div id="top-center">
	<div id="left_box">
		<p>The olympic games are a global event for professional athletes that occurs every four years in a predetermined host city. The Olympics sees many hundreds of athletes every year participating in events from archery to swimming and everything in between. Despite many countries from around the world participating regularly in the games, a handful of major countries almost invariably have the most success.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="left_box">
		<p>In order to investigate this trend, the map below shows the number of olympic medals (bronze, silver or gold) won at the olympics by athletes from given countries, normalised by the population of those countries. We should expect to see a reasonably similar score for countries around the world, but in reality we find that a small number of countries perform very well, while many others are not as successful.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="right_box">
		<p>Small, wealthy countries like Australia, Norway and Iceland seem to perform the best. But surely developing countries that are growing should be showing the greatest improvement from year to year, owing to their rapidly growing economy and populations. This may or may not be the case, so we shall investigate this in the next visualisation by comparing each country's historical performance with recent performance.</p>
	</div>
</div>
	
<div id="one-center">
	<div id="vis1"></div>
</div>

<div id="two-center">
	<div id="left2_box">
		<p>Examining the map to the right, we again see that many major countries are becoming even more successful in the Olympics while less successful African and South American countries are actually performing worse than ever, with many not scoring a single medal in the 2014 and 2016 Olympic games. This is the opposite of what we expected to see, and we need an explanation for it.</p>
		<p>This seems to be a systemic issue, and goes against the idea of an equal global stage for professional athletes. Without delving into statistics to come to a concrete conclusion, we will explore two possibilities for the worsening of performance of some less fortunate countries around the world. We will investigate the economic conditions of participating countries, as well as if the Olympic games are growing or shrinking each year which may reduce the number of medals awarded in total.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="left3_box">
		<div id="vis2"></div>

<div id="three-center">
	<div id="left_box">
		<div id="vis3"></div>
	</div>
	<div id="left_box">
		<p>On the left we have a simple log-log scatter plot that compares the normalised average medals won for each country against their GDP per capita. We can see a clear trend here, which leads us to believe that countries which perform poorly in the Olympics may do so because of economic reasons.</p>
		
		<p>On the right we can clearly see that the Olympic games are growing rapidly, with more and mroe medals being awarded each year, meaning there is no excuse for minor countries around the world being under represented.</p>
